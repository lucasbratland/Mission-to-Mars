# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
This project consisted on a Python script to scrape text and images from various websites that talked about Mission to Mars. We then used a Flask web application with a rendered HTML template designed using Bootstrap to display all the data in a central location without having to gather it manually. The data scraped and displayed was stored in a non-relational Mongo database. Additionally, I was able to connect the scraping script so that each time a button was clicked, the scraping occured once again, the database got updated, and new data was displayed.
